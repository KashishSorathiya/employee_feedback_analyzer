Purpose of Each Dependency
Here’s what each package does in our project:

colorama==0.4.6
Provides cross-platform colored text output in the terminal (optional for better CLI experience).

contourpy==1.3.0
Backend library used by matplotlib for creating complex contour plots and improving chart rendering.

cycler==0.12.1
Manages color cycles and style settings in matplotlib for consistent chart visuals.

fonttools==4.59.0
Enables advanced font handling in matplotlib for rendering readable and styled charts.

importlib-resources==6.5.2
Helps in managing internal resource files (e.g., templates, configs) packaged with Python modules.

joblib==1.5.1
Speeds up processing by enabling caching and parallelization, useful if sentiment analysis expands to large datasets.

kiwisolver==1.4.7
A dependency of matplotlib for solving layout constraints in figure rendering.

matplotlib==3.9.4
The core library for visualizing analysis results (rating distribution, department charts, sentiment plots).

nltk==3.9.1
Natural Language Toolkit – used for text processing (tokenization, stopword removal) and improving sentiment analysis accuracy.

numpy==2.0.2
Handles numerical computations and matrix operations, used internally by pandas and matplotlib.

packaging==25.0
Helps manage versioning and packaging metadata for libraries.

pandas==2.3.1
The backbone for loading, cleaning, grouping, and analyzing employee feedback data.

pillow==11.3.0
Image processing library used by matplotlib for saving visual outputs like charts in PNG format.

pyparsing==3.2.3
Helps with parsing syntax in matplotlib for complex chart configurations.

python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
Simplifies working with dates/timestamps (e.g., for versioned report filenames).

pytz==2025.2 & tzdata==2025.2
Handle timezone-aware date/time operations for report generation and timestamping.

regex==2025.7.31
Enhanced regular expression library for better keyword extraction and text preprocessing.

six==1.17.0
Ensures Python 2/3 compatibility for some dependent libraries (matplotlib, nltk).

textblob==0.19.0
Main library for sentiment analysis (classifying feedback as Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

tqdm==4.67.1
Provides a progress bar for long-running operations (future-proofing if we add batch analysis).

zipp==3.23.0
Used internally by importlib-resources for managing compressed resources.
